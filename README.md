# event-countdown-timer

 I have designed html form page using bootstrap.
Also the form is creating an objet on submission and store the data in local storage .
Then on submission all the new  data will be visible on user interface as event listing of upcoming events and previous data fetched from local storage on page refresh.
Countdown is also displayed with every events calculating remaining time .
